# LQT-Oracle
## This repo contains the link of terrain datasets and code of LQT-Oracle.

## The LQT-Oracle is a indexing-based data structure for efficent arbitrary point-to-arbitrary point shortest distance queries on terrain surfaces. We do not impose any assumption on the query points and the terrain could be both weighted or unweighted.

## The terrain datasets we use are from **Distance Oracle on Terrain Surface. SIGMOD Conference 2017: 1211-1226** and **Close Weighted Shortest Paths on 3D Terrain Surfaces. SIGSPATIAL/GIS 2020: 597-607**. Here is the link of the datasets we use: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HMhKqvZRO3d7LX2TtShlp3cGoUa4JIpT?usp=sharing.
